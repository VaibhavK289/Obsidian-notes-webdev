There are three types of commands used for creating variables in JavaScript 
const , let and var.

Syntax 
1. const variable_name = value_of_variable (value of this variable cannot be changed.)
2. let variable_name = value_of_variable (value of this type of variable can be changed later.)
3. var variable_name = value_of_variable (value of  this type can be changed.)

Note - var is not used anymore because of problems in block scope and functional scope.
Note - variable can also be created without using any of the keywords, but it is not a good practice.

variables are used to create a memory space which can be used to store data.

If value of variable is not defined then:
1. using console.log() will give a reference error and value will be undefined.
2. using console.table([]) will not give error instead value of the variable will be printed as undefined.
