Commands used to print in JavaScript are:
1. console.log() - it is used to print variables, strings etc.
2. console.table([]) - it is used to create a table and print elements present inside it. It can also be used to print multiple elements at the same time.
3. // -  it is used to create commands.
4. /star star/ - it is used to create multiline command.
5. "use strict " - treats all the JScode as newer version code (comes under good practice.)
6. alert () - used to create a popup in browser (basically a print statement but in browser.) but cannot be used in node.
7. Code readability is the priority.
8. MDN is used for documentation (not the official documentation but best out there, created and maintained by Mozilla organization.)
